# YING Zhang
As a third year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cambridge, my publication and research interests are in the area of mathematical pedagogy, mathematical creativity, and creative self-efficacy. I am also the Editor-in-Chief of CERJ to lead the publication of Volume 11. Prior to this, I completed my MPhil degree at Cambridge with distinction, and a bachelor's degree in Science (Mathematics and its Application Specialist) from the University of Toronto, achieving 100% in Real Analysis. 

I am also an educational blogger with 300k followers on the Chinese social media platform "XiaoHongShu" and "Bilibili", on which I share free mathematics knowledge to students of all levels, ranging from elementary to university level.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I ventured into entrepreneurship during my undergraduate studies in Toronto. I founded and operated the nail design salon "Le Secret Nails," where I assumed the roles of both founder and principal nail designer.

## Research Experience
### Editor-in-Chief, Cambridge Educational Research e-Journal (CERJ)  
Lead the publication of CERJ‚Äôs Volume 11 by developing and managing the overall vision, timelines, funding, and direction for the journal; managed the CERJ team, including delegating tasks and recruiting sub-editors.
Mediated and liaised between contributors and reviewers; maintained effective communication between CERJ and the Faculty of Education in University of Cambridge.

### Panel Coordinator, Cambridge China Education Forum (CCEF)   
Founded the forum of ‚ÄúSTEAM Education‚Äù; Invite speakers, host annual forum and workshops to bridge the gap between scholars and practitioners in the field of STEAM Education.
Facilitate cross-border dialogues on China‚Äôs education and its global implications among stakeholders in the UK, China, and beyond.

### Mathematics Research Assistant
Work as a temporary research assistant for Cambridge Mathematics Framework (CMF), providing consultancy services and expert advice on project development to ensure its success.
Contracted to assist the Client (Ukarine government) with their project by mapping international curricula to the CMF.

## Focus of Study
### Mathematical Pedagogy
Used the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) to investigate to what extent does the pedagogy at a purported reformed school meets the description of the student-centered pedagogy (SCP) as elaborated in the international literature. 
Investigated teachers‚Äô epistemological belief about their pedagogy, and the great challenges and the corresponding solutions of implementing Student-centered pedagogy in mathematics classrooms, including how to build a student-centered social mathematical norms.

### Mathematical Creativity
Explore the relationship between pedagogy and mathematical creativity towards mathematics by comparing the mathematical creativity of students who experienced more student-centered pedagogy (SCP) with that of students who experienced more teacher-centered pedagogy (TCP). 
Use problem-posing tasks and multiple-solution tasks to indicate mathematical creativity in terms of fluency, flexibility, originality, and creative thinking level; The relationship between problem posing and problem solving was also explored in terms of measuring mathematical creativity.
Explore students‚Äô difficulties in mathematical problem posing and researchers‚Äô dilemma in analyzing mathematical creativity via problem posing tasks.

### Mathematical Creative Self-efficacy
Investigated whether the creative self-efficacy serves as an important mediator or an explanatory factor between pedagogy and creativity. 
Found that receiving SCP within a year can foster students'¬†creative self-efficacy towards mathematics. However, such advantages was not present when students have received SCP more than two years. Also, SCP could potentially amplify the creative self-efficacy disparities between genders and grade levels than TCP does.
